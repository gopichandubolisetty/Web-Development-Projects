# Full-Stack Web Development Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my practice projects and exercises completed while learning full-stack web development.

## üìÅ Structure

* **/Front-End**: Contains projects focused on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks.
* **/Back-End**: Contains projects focused on Node.js, Express, APIs, and databases.

## My Learning Process

Within each project folder, you may find my own code alongside the final solutions provided by the course materials. This reflects my process of attempting each problem myself before studying the correct implementation.

Feel free to browse the folders to see my work.
